# ScatterPlot
This repository includes a way to visualize genom data as scatterplot to find synteny parts.

## The data
The file "data_sets/Arabidopsis/Arabidopsis.Release5.matchList" from [DAGchainer: Computing Chains of Syntenic Genes in Complete Genomes](http://dagchainer.sourceforge.net/) was used to build up our own JSON-datastructur. Thanks a lot!
